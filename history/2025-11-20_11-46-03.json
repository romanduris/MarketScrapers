    "AIComment": "Despite a recent downturn in the broader market and a neutral sector trend, Incyte shows potential for a short-term trade given its strong fundamentals such as a reasonable TrailingPE and positive revenue growth. However, the recent negative momentum and a high RSI suggest potential overvaluation or a pullback, making it a risky bet for a 2-10 day trading window.",
