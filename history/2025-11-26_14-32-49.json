    "AIComment": "NiSource shows a neutral short-term trading outlook due to mixed signals in market and sector trends. While the overall market is trending up, the utilities sector remains neutral, which might limit the stock's upside potential. The stock's technical indicators like a close EMA and negative MACD divergence suggest caution, making it a less attractive option for a 2-10 day trade.",
