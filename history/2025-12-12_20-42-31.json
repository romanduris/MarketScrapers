    "AIComment": "Marriott International (MAR) shows a neutral market and sector trend, with a slight positive momentum over the past week and two months. The stock's recent performance, coupled with a positive news sentiment and a MACD close to its signal, suggests a potentially stable but not strongly bullish short-term outlook. Given the neutral trends and moderate technical indicators, the stock might not present a strong trading opportunity in the next 2-10 days.",
