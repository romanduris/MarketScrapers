    "AIComment": "Dollar Tree shows a strong sector performance with an upward trend, which could support the stock in the short term. However, the high RSI of 76.62 suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a pullback. The mixed signals from the neutral market trend and the recent price decline of -2.49% also add to the uncertainty, making it a potentially risky short-term trade.",
