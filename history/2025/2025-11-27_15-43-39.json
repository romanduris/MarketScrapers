    "AIComment": "McKesson Corporation shows potential for a short-term trade, given the positive momentum in both the broader market and healthcare sector. The stock's recent performance, with a positive MACD above its signal and a stable RSI, suggests strength. However, a slight recent price decline and a high trailing PE ratio could indicate some caution is warranted.",
