    "AIComment": "Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) shows a mixed short-term trading outlook. The overall market is trending upwards, which is favorable, but the neutral trend in the Consumer Cyclical sector and the recent negative price change of -1.86% suggest potential volatility. The high RSI of 66.59 indicates the stock might be nearing overbought conditions, which could limit upside potential in the next 2-10 days.",
