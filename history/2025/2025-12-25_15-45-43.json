    "AIComment": "Targa Resources (TRGP) shows a mixed short-term trading outlook. The overall market is trending upwards, which is generally positive. However, the energy sector remains neutral, and the company's high Debt to Equity ratio could pose risks. The stock's technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest moderate momentum, but the recent slight negative price change and neutral sector trend might limit upside potential in the next 2-10 days.",
