    "AIComment": "Duke Energy (DUK) shows a neutral short-term trading outlook as both the market and sector trends are neutral. The stock's recent performance, including a slight positive momentum over the past week and a stable RSI, suggests moderate stability. However, the negative MACD value indicates potential short-term downward pressure. Given these mixed signals, the stock might not present a strong buying or selling opportunity in the next 2-10 days.",
