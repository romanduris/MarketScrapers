    "AITicker": "Corpay, a company operating in the technology sector, focuses on payment and financial solutions.",
    "AIComment": "Corpay shows a neutral market trend but a downward sector trend, which might limit its short-term growth potential. The stock's technical indicators like a high RSI and positive MACD divergence suggest some bullish momentum, yet the sector's negative performance could pose risks. Considering these mixed signals, trading this stock in the next 2-10 days carries moderate risk.",
