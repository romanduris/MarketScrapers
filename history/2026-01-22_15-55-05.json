    "AIComment": "WEC Energy Group shows a neutral market and sector trend, which might limit significant price movements in the short term. The stock's recent performance with a slight weekly momentum gain and a positive MACD above its signal suggests some bullish behavior. However, the overall neutral trends and a slight negative momentum over two months could dampen any major upside. Therefore, trading this stock in the next 2-10 days carries moderate risk.",
