    "AIComment": "KeyCorp (KEY) shows a neutral short-term trading outlook due to mixed signals from the broader market and sector trends. While the overall market is trending upwards, the financial sector remains neutral, which might limit the stock's upside potential. The stock's technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a lack of strong momentum, making it a less attractive option for a 2-10 day trade.",
