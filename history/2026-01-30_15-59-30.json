    "AIComment": "FedEx shows a neutral short-term trading outlook, aligning with the overall market and sector trends. The stock's recent performance, indicated by a slight negative percent change and moderate RSI, suggests stability but limited upside potential in the next 2-10 days. The positive MACD above its signal line and a decent news sentiment provide some support, yet the neutral trends and modest momentum scores temper expectations for significant movement.",
