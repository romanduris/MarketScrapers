    "AIComment": "Everest Group (EG) shows a neutral short-term trading outlook, with both the market and sector exhibiting neutral trends over the past 5 days. The stock's recent performance, including a slight negative revenue growth and a minor decrease in price, suggests limited upside potential in the 2-10 day window. Positive news sentiment and a recovering MACD signal provide some support, but overall momentum and market alignment do not strongly favor a bullish short-term trade.",
